We’ve heeded the valuable feedback from our users, including producers and audio engineers, and we’re thrilled to announce this update designed to make podcasting with Dovetail an increasingly seamless and efficient experience.</p>

<p>Producers will now see improved audio upload speeds, navigability, and UX. We’ve also improved multiple existing features, like enhanced tooling around our embeddable player and introduced new features such as single file segmentation:</p>

<picture><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/feeder/1-200-074bb9bca.webp 200w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/1-400-074bb9bca.webp 400w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/1-800-074bb9bca.webp 800w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/1-1200-074bb9bca.webp 1200w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/1-1394-074bb9bca.webp 1394w" type="image/webp" /><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/feeder/1-200-93585fe6b.png 200w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/1-400-93585fe6b.png 400w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/1-800-93585fe6b.png 800w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/1-1200-93585fe6b.png 1200w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/1-1394-93585fe6b.png 1394w" type="image/png" /><img src="/assets/generated/img/feeder/1-800-93585fe6b.png" alt="screenshot of Dovetail' podcast landing page" width="1394" height="939" /></picture>

<p>With a podcast selector and a new landing page dedicated to finding content, producers can also effortlessly and swiftly locate the exact podcast or episode they are seeking, enhancing the overall efficiency of their navigation experience:</p>

<picture><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/feeder/2-200-d6ee32a8a.webp 200w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/2-400-d6ee32a8a.webp 400w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/2-800-d6ee32a8a.webp 800w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/2-1200-d6ee32a8a.webp 1200w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/2-1394-d6ee32a8a.webp 1394w" type="image/webp" /><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/feeder/2-200-4149720da.png 200w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/2-400-4149720da.png 400w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/2-800-4149720da.png 800w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/2-1200-4149720da.png 1200w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/2-1394-4149720da.png 1394w" type="image/png" /><img src="/assets/generated/img/feeder/2-800-4149720da.png" alt="screenshot of Dovetail's podcast landing page" width="1394" height="1037" /></picture>

<p>The new podcasts dashboard will include the most recent episodes, links to all elements that can be updated, and give a quick insight into the podcast’s performance over the past 30 days.</p>

<h2 id="audio-segmentation">Audio Segmentation</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most exciting new feature is the ability to mark a single audio file with ad timings. Dovetail has previously asked producers to upload pre-cut audio files to create an episode, a workflow that works well for radio broadcast audio engineers and producers. But, we know podcast producers also enjoy the ability to upload a single file and provide the ad markers.</p>

<p>We’re pleased to say that we now support both workflows. This way, your team can choose the workflow that works best for you:</p>

<picture><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/feeder/3-200-a034dc00b.webp 200w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/3-400-a034dc00b.webp 400w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/3-800-a034dc00b.webp 800w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/3-1200-a034dc00b.webp 1200w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/3-1394-a034dc00b.webp 1394w" type="image/webp" /><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/feeder/3-200-6a9b1b11c.png 200w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/3-400-6a9b1b11c.png 400w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/3-800-6a9b1b11c.png 800w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/3-1200-6a9b1b11c.png 1200w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/3-1394-6a9b1b11c.png 1394w" type="image/png" /><img src="/assets/generated/img/feeder/3-800-6a9b1b11c.png" alt="screenshot of Dovetail's audio segmenter tool" width="1394" height="1233" /></picture>

<p>Another feature of the audio segmenter is the ability to lightly edit the audio file within Dovetail. Producers can trim silence off the front and ends of the file — using the Preroll and Postroll timings — and choose an end time for the midroll injection:</p>

<picture><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/feeder/4-200-db9ddea94.webp 200w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/4-400-db9ddea94.webp 400w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/4-800-db9ddea94.webp 800w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/4-1200-db9ddea94.webp 1200w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/4-1394-db9ddea94.webp 1394w" type="image/webp" /><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/feeder/4-200-2e3ec5ae9.png 200w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/4-400-2e3ec5ae9.png 400w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/4-800-2e3ec5ae9.png 800w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/4-1200-2e3ec5ae9.png 1200w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/4-1394-2e3ec5ae9.png 1394w" type="image/png" /><img src="/assets/generated/img/feeder/4-800-2e3ec5ae9.png" alt="screenshot of uploading audio by segment" width="1394" height="625" /></picture>

<p>After the audio files are uploaded and processed, Dovetail will create segments out of the files to stitch up and deliver the right arrangement of ads or no ads to listeners.</p>

<h2 id="ad-breaks">Ad Breaks</h2>
<p>We’ve also made it easier to determine the proper structure for an episode to follow. Previously, we relied on pre-set templates with custom names. No more! Now, producers can simply add the number of Ad Breaks for each episode.</p>

<p>Ad breaks represent the number of midroll sections in the episode. Therefore, an ad-free trailer would have zero ad breaks, and actual episodes can have the number of midrolls that the producer feels is necessary:</p>

<picture><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/feeder/5-200-a25e531df.webp 200w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/5-400-a25e531df.webp 400w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/5-800-a25e531df.webp 800w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/5-1142-a25e531df.webp 1142w" type="image/webp" /><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/feeder/5-200-2a7b40883.png 200w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/5-400-2a7b40883.png 400w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/5-800-2a7b40883.png 800w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/5-1142-2a7b40883.png 1142w" type="image/png" /><img src="/assets/generated/img/feeder/5-800-2a7b40883.png" alt="screenshot of defining ad breaks in the Production Calendar" width="1142" height="184" /></picture>

<p>Setting the number of Ad Breaks while planning episodes using the improved Episode Planner will allow for more accurate forecasting of ad impressions for your content.</p>

<h2 id="embeddable-player-tooling">Embeddable Player Tooling</h2>
<p>There are new customizations now available for the PRX embeddable player within Dovetail. For instance, producers can choose between player styles and even the color theme to match the website:</p>

<picture><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/feeder/6-200-8bfa8efd4.webp 200w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/6-400-8bfa8efd4.webp 400w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/6-800-8bfa8efd4.webp 800w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/6-1200-8bfa8efd4.webp 1200w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/6-1394-8bfa8efd4.webp 1394w" type="image/webp" /><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/feeder/6-200-f3cd559ce.png 200w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/6-400-f3cd559ce.png 400w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/6-800-f3cd559ce.png 800w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/6-1200-f3cd559ce.png 1200w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/6-1394-f3cd559ce.png 1394w" type="image/png" /><img src="/assets/generated/img/feeder/6-800-f3cd559ce.png" alt="screenshot of the PRX embeddable player config on episode pages" width="1394" height="1055" /></picture>

<p>And, it’s now easier than before to build an embeddable playlist of your show’s content:</p>

<picture><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/feeder/7-200-b4aaa2474.webp 200w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/7-400-b4aaa2474.webp 400w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/7-800-b4aaa2474.webp 800w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/7-1200-b4aaa2474.webp 1200w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/7-1394-b4aaa2474.webp 1394w" type="image/webp" /><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/feeder/7-200-a8573870b.png 200w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/7-400-a8573870b.png 400w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/7-800-a8573870b.png 800w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/7-1200-a8573870b.png 1200w, /assets/generated/img/feeder/7-1394-a8573870b.png 1394w" type="image/png" /><img src="/assets/generated/img/feeder/7-800-a8573870b.png" alt="screenshot of the PRX Embeddable player playlist feature" width="1394" height="1354" /></picture>

We’ve also <a href="https://medium.com/prxofficial/prx-bolsters-its-dovetail-podcast-publishing-platform-increasing-services-available-to-public-64aae9c91709">previously shared</a> Dovetail’s capabilities to empower producers with trusted post-production tools for content management, real-time data and analytics, and scalable dynamic advertising.</p>

<p>We’re pleased to share another exciting update: producers may now create multiple RSS feeds within Dovetail, increasing the ways podcasts may be distributed and monetized.</p>

<p>RSS feeds simplify the process of distributing podcast episodes to various platforms and directories. With an RSS feed, podcasters can syndicate their content to popular podcast platforms, allowing listeners to access their episodes with ease. This streamlined distribution process eliminates the need for manual uploads and submissions to individual platforms, saving time for producers.</p>

<picture><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/feeds1-200-a35181933.webp 200w, /assets/generated/img/feeds1-400-a35181933.webp 400w, /assets/generated/img/feeds1-720-a35181933.webp 720w" type="image/webp" /><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/feeds1-200-e44cbc306.png 200w, /assets/generated/img/feeds1-400-e44cbc306.png 400w, /assets/generated/img/feeds1-720-e44cbc306.png 720w" type="image/png" /><img src="/assets/generated/img/feeds1-720-e44cbc306.png" alt="Screenshot of Dovetail's multiple feeds feature" width="720" height="400" /></picture>

<p><strong>There are several compelling use cases for the multiple feeds feature within Dovetail:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Integration with a Podcast Subscription Service —</strong> By creating separate feeds within Dovetail, podcasters can seamlessly integrate with podcast subscription services such as <a href="https://www.supercast.com/">Supercast</a> or <a href="https://www.supportingcast.fm/">Supporting Cast</a> (Note: support for Apple Podcasts Subscriptions is forthcoming). This allows producers to provide exclusive content or bonus episodes to their subscribed members, offering a unique value proposition to their loyal audiences.</li>
  <li><strong>Private Ad-Free Feeds for Platforms or Networks —</strong> By creating a dedicated feed without advertisements, podcasters can establish partnerships with platforms or networks that prioritize an ad-free listening experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Special Feeds for Bonus Content —</strong> Dovetail’s multiple feeds feature enables podcasters to set up feeds dedicated solely to bonus content. Whether it’s behind-the-scenes interviews, extended episodes, or exclusive interviews, these special feeds provide an additional avenue to engage dedicated listeners.</li>
  <li><strong>Content Windowing —</strong> Podcasters may utilize Dovetail’s multiple feeds feature to implement content windowing strategies. By delaying the release of specific episodes in certain feeds, podcasters can provide early access or exclusive content to select listeners or partners.</li>
</ul>

<p>By leveraging the multiple feeds feature within Dovetail, podcasters can explore these use cases or implement tailored distribution strategies catering to the needs and preferences of their audiences and partners.</p>

Web Monetization is a way to reward creators with real-time micropayments for their work while protecting privacy and supporting an open web. We see this as part of our larger goals to protect listener privacy and an open podcasting ecosystem.</p>

<p>With help from <a href="https://www.grantfortheweb.org/">Grant for The Web</a>, PRX built support for Web Monetization into our platform, and we are working with key creators to experiment with using these payments on their shows and websites, like “<a href="https://songexploder.net/"><em>Song Exploder</em></a>.”</p>

<h2 id="micropayments">Micropayments</h2>

<p>In podcasting, and the internet in general, there are many ways to monetize: sponsorship, advertising, subscriptions, or for the lucky few, a book or movie deal. Still, every choice is a matter of trade-offs. Advertising costs attention and often entails tracking people’s internet activity (and thus, a loss of privacy). Subscriptions limit audiences and require signing up for yet another service. Movie deals…well, alright, that’s nice work if you can get it.</p>

<p>A still nascent form of monetization is micropayments. With micropayments, people sign up to reward creators based on their attention, and then creators receive a stream of payments when someone reads, views, or listens to their work online on a platform that enables payments. Micropayments are already happening with <a href="https://podcastindex.org/podcast/value4value">Podcasting 2.0’s Value 4 Value</a>, and many podcasters (&gt; 10,000) have adopted micropayments using <a href="https://podnews.net/article/how-to-earn-bitcoin-from-your-podcast">Bitcoin over the Lightning network</a>.</p>

<p>But, for all the potential, the trade-off with micropayments is the technical and behavioral challenge of getting people to adopt the technology. To effectively adopt micropayments, you need consumers to sign up and enable payments, a way to know when content is consumed, <em>and</em> an affordable means to send payments. Ideally, all of this would be enabled to work on any website, anywhere, and not be limited by currency or vendor, and everyone would use it.</p>

<h2 id="web-monetization">Web Monetization</h2>

<p>Web Monetization meets the technical challenges of micropayments. It is a <a href="https://webmonetization.org/specification.html">proposed standard</a> with the W3C, the same international consortium that established all the major standards for the World Wide Web. Unlike other micropayment attempts like Value 4 Value that requires Bitcoin or <a href="https://brave.com/brave-rewards/">Brave that uses the Basic Attention Token (BAT)</a>, Web Monetization is not tied to a specific currency, implementation, or proprietary technology. Like other web technologies, it is based on standards that are meant to have many competing implementations, just as Mozilla, Google, and Microsoft all implement web standards in their own browsers. Another open standard that Web Monetization depends on is the <a href="https://interledger.org/developer-tools/get-started/overview/">Interledger payments protocol</a>, which is built for transferring payments between banks, ledgers, and currencies, allowing payments to flow without requiring any single payment provider or financial institution.</p>

<p>For example, if a person only wants to pay or receive traditional fiat currencies like USD, they can do so. The payments move through payment routers like data through a network, with defined start and end points, but no particular currency or payment provider required along the way, though in current implementations, they will often go through the <a href="https://xrpl.org/">XRP Ledger</a>, an open-source, low-cost, energy-efficient blockchain built for making micropayments.</p>

<p>Even with all these technical advantages, there is still the behavioral challenge to adopting Web Monetization by consumers, creators, and the technologists that build on these standards. To that end, the <a href="https://interledger.org/">Interledger Foundation</a>, <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/web-monetization/">Mozilla</a>, <a href="https://creativecommons.org/2019/09/16/grant-for-the-web">Creative Commons</a>, <a href="https://interledger.org/">Interledger</a>, and <a href="https://coil.com/">Coil</a>, all recognizing that bootstrapping adoption of a new ecosystem is no small matter, and who together created <a href="https://www.grantfortheweb.org/">Grant for the Web</a> to support this new open payments ecosystem.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-for-creators-and-audiences">Getting Started for Creators and Audiences</h2>

<p>For creators to get started, they need an online wallet, like an <a href="https://webmonetization.org/docs/uphold/">Uphold</a> account, to receive money via the protocol that handles micropayments (i.e. <a href="https://interledger.org/developer-tools/get-started/overview/">Interledger</a>).</p>

<p>With a wallet, they get a public address for receiving payments, something like the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@First-Lastname</code> addresses Venmo and similar (proprietary) services provide. Public addresses for Web Monetization are called <a href="https://webmonetization.org/docs/ilp-wallets/#payment-pointers">Payment Pointer</a>, and look something like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ilp.uphold.com/ABC3DefGHijk</code>.</p>

<p>Much like an email address is how folks send messages to someone, this payment pointer is how they send payments to a creator. To use it, the address needs to be available and enabled where an audience pays attention to work on the web, and the audience needs to have set up paying for that work.</p>

<p>Wallets provide a way for a creator to receive payments, while a membership with <a href="https://coil.com">Coil</a> (and <a href="https://help.coil.com/docs/membership/coil-extension/index.html">installing a browser extension</a>) is how a fan can send money. Each Coil member who pays $5 a month supports web-monetized content with $0.36 per hour of attention. This may not sound like much, but it adds up, especially when compared to advertising. A thousand listens to a podcast, with three mid-rolls at a $20 CPM, would only pay $60, but if those same thousand listeners play 30 minutes of content, that’s $180.</p>

<p>Wallets and memberships are the two hands reaching out to make Web Monetization connect. When used in combination, if a <a href="https://webmonetization.org/docs/getting-started#4-add-the-meta-tag-to-your-website">Coil</a> member visits monetized content, all a creator needs is <a href="https://webmonetization.org/docs/getting-started#4-add-the-meta-tag-to-your-website">a single tag</a> on their site, link their <a href="https://help.coil.com/docs/monetize/content/youtube-monetize-channel/index.html">YouTube channel</a>, or add it to their PRX-hosted podcast to enable payments.</p>

<h2 id="web-monetization-with-dovetail">Web Monetization with Dovetail</h2>

<p>For podcasters using <a href="/">Dovetail from PRX</a>, it’s simple to get started with Web Monetization (and all explained in <a href="https://help.prx.org/hc/en-us/articles/9901810244251-How-can-I-set-up-micropayments-for-my-podcast-">this help article</a>).</p>

<p>On any podcast in Dovetail, a producer can paste in a payment pointer address, hit save, and the feed will be updated to include the address and enable monetization:</p>

<picture><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/web-mon-1-200-0a423acfd.webp 200w, /assets/generated/img/web-mon-1-400-0a423acfd.webp 400w, /assets/generated/img/web-mon-1-800-0a423acfd.webp 800w, /assets/generated/img/web-mon-1-874-0a423acfd.webp 874w" type="image/webp" /><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/web-mon-1-200-93f134f14.jpg 200w, /assets/generated/img/web-mon-1-400-93f134f14.jpg 400w, /assets/generated/img/web-mon-1-800-93f134f14.jpg 800w, /assets/generated/img/web-mon-1-874-93f134f14.jpg 874w" type="image/jpeg" /><img src="/assets/generated/img/web-mon-1-800-93f134f14.jpg" alt="Setting up Web Monetization in Dovetail" width="874" height="530" /></picture>

<h3 id="a-web-monetized-podcast-player">A Web Monetized Podcast Player</h3>
<p>Adding the payment pointer to the feed is essential, but we also need podcast players to be Web Monetization enabled and make use of it. PRX also supports an open-source web player for podcasts, so we added support for web monetization in our own player, the very one used already by many of our podcasters like on “<a href="https://songexploder.net/"><em>Song Exploder</em></a>” and “<a href="https://bookexploder.com/"><em>Book Exploder</em></a>.”</p>

<p>Now, when someone using web monetization listens to an episode on the <a href="https://bookexploder.com/episodes/james-mcbride"><em>Book Exploder</em></a> website, they will send payments while they listen, with the dollar sign icon showing that monetization is happening:</p>

<picture><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/web-mon-2-200-8490431f0.webp 200w, /assets/generated/img/web-mon-2-400-8490431f0.webp 400w, /assets/generated/img/web-mon-2-800-8490431f0.webp 800w, /assets/generated/img/web-mon-2-1200-8490431f0.webp 1200w, /assets/generated/img/web-mon-2-1600-8490431f0.webp 1600w" type="image/webp" /><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/web-mon-2-200-179a9d9a7.png 200w, /assets/generated/img/web-mon-2-400-179a9d9a7.png 400w, /assets/generated/img/web-mon-2-800-179a9d9a7.png 800w, /assets/generated/img/web-mon-2-1200-179a9d9a7.png 1200w, /assets/generated/img/web-mon-2-1600-179a9d9a7.png 1600w" type="image/png" /><img src="/assets/generated/img/web-mon-2-800-179a9d9a7.png" alt="An example PRX Player showing the monetization dollar sign in the bottom right corner" width="1600" height="373" /></picture>

<p>Clicking on the dollar sign icon shows a visualization for the streaming payments, and how much money has been sent while listening:</p>

<picture><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/web-mon-3-200-977f88277.webp 200w, /assets/generated/img/web-mon-3-400-977f88277.webp 400w, /assets/generated/img/web-mon-3-800-977f88277.webp 800w, /assets/generated/img/web-mon-3-1200-977f88277.webp 1200w, /assets/generated/img/web-mon-3-1600-977f88277.webp 1600w" type="image/webp" /><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/web-mon-3-200-221bad62a.png 200w, /assets/generated/img/web-mon-3-400-221bad62a.png 400w, /assets/generated/img/web-mon-3-800-221bad62a.png 800w, /assets/generated/img/web-mon-3-1200-221bad62a.png 1200w, /assets/generated/img/web-mon-3-1600-221bad62a.png 1600w" type="image/png" /><img src="/assets/generated/img/web-mon-3-800-221bad62a.png" alt="The player showing payments streaming from the listener to the creator during playback" width="1999" height="307" /></picture>

<p>To make this work, Dovetail adds the payment pointer in a special tag in the RSS feed for the player to use to stream payments during playback. But we didn’t want to update the feed in a way that only works for PRX, we built on the work at the <a href="https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/issues/132">Podcast Index defining monetization</a> in RSS, and further on how the folks at <a href="https://blog.castopod.org/castopod-supports-web-monetization/">Castopod built support for Web Monetization</a>. The result is a <a href="https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/pull/409">Podcasting 2.0 proposal for a standard way to use web monetization for podcasting</a> that should work for any podcast host, and can be adopted by any podcast website or web player.</p>

<p>This is important, because when you believe in standards, it means working to support and bolster the work and inventions of others. As a practical result, it also means what we’ve built is interoperable, so with help from the team at <a href="https://blog.castopod.org/castopod-supports-web-monetization/">Castopod</a>, Castopod hosted podcasts can also receive payments from the open source PRX player.</p>

<p>For example, this Castopod hosted show “<a href="https://lespoesiesdheloise.fr/@heloise">Les Poésies d’Héloïse</a>” can use the <a href="https://play.prx.org/e?uf=https://lespoesiesdheloise.fr/@heloise/feed.xml">PRX embeddable player</a> to receive web monetized payments, just exactly like one hosted on Dovetail:</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h3>

<p>As we advance an open podcasting ecosystem, we need more of the kind of collaboration and interoperability that standards provide and experiments to learn how best to use them.</p>

<p>As you might expect with experimental tech, there are still some limitations to how this works.</p>

<p>One shortcoming is that the current Web Monetization is really only for the web and isn’t integrated into mobile apps, which account for much of podcast listening. This is true of other types of media consumption as well and will eventually be addressed as the standards gain adoption.</p>

<p>Another is that payments only flow when the <a href="https://github.com/WICG/webmonetization/issues/17">browser is in the foreground</a>, which is perfect for text and video but not for audio. The equivalent for podcasts and music might be to stream payments when the sound is playing unmuted and loud enough to hear but unrelated to the browser focus or visual placement.</p>

<p>And the main limitation is not enough folks have <a href="https://coil.com/">signed up to use Web Monetization to reward creators</a> for it to replace other sources of revenue.</p>

<p>If we want the future to be more equitable, open, and privacy safe, we have to be willing to experiment and work for it. We invite you all to <a href="https://help.prx.org/hc/en-us/articles/9901810244251-How-can-I-set-up-micropayments-for-my-podcast-">join us in this experiment</a>, <a href="https://community.interledger.org/page/intro-to-web-monetization">learn more</a> about Web Monetization than this one post can convey, and think critically about how the choices we make affect creators, listeners, and the open web.</p>]]></content><author><name>Andrew Kuklewicz</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Micropayments are a privacy safe alternative for unlocking additional producer revenue.

<p><strong>Download:</strong> A podcast episode download. As defined by the <a href="https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PodcastMeasurement_v2.1.pdf">IAB 2.1 Podcast Measurement guidelines</a>, a listener must download enough of the episode creative file for 1-minute of audio to be counted.</p>

<p><strong>Impression:</strong> A podcast ad impression. Also defined in the <a href="https://iabtechlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/PodcastMeasurement_v2.1.pdf">IAB 2.1 Podcast Measurement guidelines</a>, the listener must have downloaded all of the bytes in the episode creative file where the ad can be heard to be counted.
<em>Also see: “Actual”</em></p>

<h2 id="podcast-layouts">Podcast Layouts</h2>

<p><strong>Placements:</strong> The configured layouts of a podcast’s audio segments. Each is made up of a list of Zones. If there are no placements configured for an audio template, vanilla/ad-free audio will be served.
Example: [Preroll1 Preroll2 Original1 Midroll Original2 Postroll]</p>

<p><strong>Zone:</strong> A single audio segment within an episode, including both original and ad segments.
<em>Example: House Preroll 2</em></p>

<p><strong>Section:</strong> A grouping of consecutive ad Zones into a single block. May also distinguish between “paid” and “house” ads.
<em>Example: Preroll (containing both Preroll1 and Preroll2)</em></p>

<h2 id="ad-serving">Ad Serving</h2>

<p><strong>Campaign:</strong> Represents an Inventory Order (IO) for a single advertiser. It can contain many Flights.</p>

<p><strong>Flight:</strong> One or more creatives plus a set of targeting information to serve with a podcast. Configured with Zones, a date-range, and an Impression goal.
Ads are fulfilled by reserving Allocations against future Inventory.</p>

<p><strong>Creative:</strong> Refers to the audio file (MP3, WAV, FLAC) or VAST URL containing the ad content.</p>

<p><strong>VAST:</strong> An acronym that stands for Video Ad Serving Template. VAST is a way for multiple ad servers to communicate and serve ads, replacing individual ad audio files for a campaign with a VAST URL.</p>

<p><strong>Forecast:</strong> The daily forecasted Downloads we expect a podcast to receive in the future. May also be broken out by Episode, Country, State, Keywords, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Inventory:</strong> The daily number of Impressions available for ad Zones to be sold into in the future. (Equal to the Forecast multiplied by the ad Placements - original segment Zones do not get Inventory).</p>

<p><strong>Allocations:</strong> The daily Inventory counts reserved by a Flight. May include additional targeting info such as Episode, Country, State, Keywords, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Availability:</strong> The amount of unreserved Inventory left in the system (subtract the Allocations for whatever days/targeting you’re looking at).</p>

<p><strong>Actuals:</strong> The number of real Impressions a flight has already received.</p>]]></content><author><name>Ryan Cavis</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Commonly used podcasting terms and definitions used throughout Dovetail from PRX]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://dovetail.prx.org/assets/img/hero-features.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://dovetail.prx.org/assets/img/hero-features.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">What is Dovetail from PRX?</title><link href="https://dovetail.prx.org/2022/10/07/what-is-dovetail-from-prx" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What is Dovetail from PRX?" /><published>2022-10-07T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-10-07T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://dovetail.prx.org/2022/10/07/what-is-dovetail-from-prx</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://dovetail.prx.org/2022/10/07/what-is-dovetail-from-prx"><![CDATA[<p><em>Note: This article was originally posted on <a href="https://medium.com/prxofficial/what-is-dovetail-from-prx-e2d1b7f79c3">PRX’s company blog</a>.</em></p>

In its everyday context, a dovetail is “a joint formed by one or more tapered projections (tenons) on one piece which interlocks with corresponding notches or recesses (mortises) in another.”</p>

<p>It looks like this:</p>

<p>In our context, Dovetail refers to the platform’s power to seamlessly stitch together pieces of produced audio, a central feature of post-production needs.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-dovetail-from-prx-do">What does Dovetail from PRX do?</h2>

<p>Dovetail gives producers a smooth podcast publishing experience and the framework to grow, monetize, and sustain their podcast business in today’s open podcast ecosystem. From a birds-eye view, Dovetail does three main things: podcast distribution, data collection, and ad inventory management.</p>

<h2 id="data-that-leads-to-strategic-decisions">Data that leads to strategic decisions</h2>

<p>Through Dovetail’s near real-time data and inventory forecasting features, producers have the information they need to make decisions about their audiences and revenue opportunities.</p>

<p>With the metrics Dovetail provides, producers will understand their podcasts’ performance downloads by applications and devices and their audience size by country, state, or metro. This data is available to keep within our portal or export to your own systems.</p>

<picture><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/dt-body-5-200-9c588b9a4.webp 200w, /assets/generated/img/dt-body-5-400-9c588b9a4.webp 400w, /assets/generated/img/dt-body-5-600-9c588b9a4.webp 600w" type="image/webp" /><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/dt-body-5-200-ba345e9ca.jpeg 200w, /assets/generated/img/dt-body-5-400-ba345e9ca.jpeg 400w, /assets/generated/img/dt-body-5-600-ba345e9ca.jpeg 600w" type="image/jpeg" /><img src="/assets/generated/img/dt-body-5-600-ba345e9ca.jpeg" alt="screenshot of searching for availability in Dovetail" width="600" height="400" /></picture>

<h2 id="harness-the-full-potential-of-monetization">Harness the full potential of monetization</h2>

<p>Dovetail gives producers the confidence to sell inventory and the assurance of reaching their impressions. The impression forecast feature predicts an episode’s performance based on the show’s historical drop data. With Dovetail, sales teams can easily understand a podcast’s availability and sell-through rate at any given time in the future — ensuring all inventory is accounted for and used.</p>

<p>Producers save time, costs, and resources while also maximizing profits by hosting their podcasts on Dovetail. Our dynamic ad insertion technology easily attaches sponsorship messages into produced audio to create what listeners experience as a final, polished episode. Gone are the days of only selling ad inventory on upcoming episodes; with Dovetail’s dynamic ad insertion, timely sponsorship messages can be added to every episode in a portfolio and tailored to a specific audience.</p>

<h2 id="scale-your-podcast-without-compromising-listeners-privacy">Scale your podcast without compromising listeners’ privacy</h2>

<p>Privacy is one of the platform’s defining characteristics. Trust is a two-way street, and public media’s ability to thrive depends on our listeners’ trust in us. Sharing and misusing personal data, like IP addresses, and tracking people’s internet activity without permission violates that trust.</p>

<p>In another post, we’ll go into all the technical details of how Dovetail is at the forefront of security. Still, we’ll leave you with this: privacy regulations are strengthening, not weakening. Content creators need to be ready for how that can impact their ad sales and revenue.</p>

<p>If you already publish podcasts or are exploring podcasting, we hope you will consider Dovetail for your podcast distribution needs.</p>]]></content><author><name>Brandon Hundt</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A privacy-first suite of applications for all your podcasting needs.]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://dovetail.prx.org/assets/img/hero-stations.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://dovetail.prx.org/assets/img/hero-stations.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Introducing Inventory Management in Dovetail from PRX</title><link href="https://dovetail.prx.org/2022/07/21/introducing-dovetail-as-product" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Introducing Inventory Management in Dovetail from PRX" /><published>2022-07-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-07-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://dovetail.prx.org/2022/07/21/introducing-dovetail-as-product</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://dovetail.prx.org/2022/07/21/introducing-dovetail-as-product"><![CDATA[<p>Over the past year, PRX carefully migrated our podcasts to our latest version of Dovetail - that now includes end to end ad inventory management.</p>

<p>Our Advertising Operations (Ad-Ops) team is now able to manage advertising campaigns from front to end in one system, including near real-time forecasts and availability broken down by Geo-targets available as the inventory order (IO) is being inserted.</p>

<p>Dovetail is a podcasting post-production suite of applications that excels in delivering dynamically inserted content, including the original audio files and ad creatives to your intended audience in a privacy conscious way.</p>

<h2 id="why-we-added-inventory-management-into-dovetail">Why we added inventory management into Dovetail</h2>

<p>For many years at PRX, we’ve been using dynamic ad insertion to ensure that ads were properly inserted into podcasts. As shows were published into PRX Publish, our APIs connected to a third party ad service (Kevel) and a script we wrote “Dovetail” rearranged the mp3 files into the desired order.</p>

<p>Building your own ad server is really hard. So by using Kevel we could lean on really good technology out of the box. As our CTO, Andrew Kuklewicz, points out in <a href="https://soundsprofitable.com/article/kevel">an interview</a> with <em>Sounds Profitable</em> host Bryan Barletta, the initial integration wasn’t very difficult and at the time made sense.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CkZfvubCfSE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>However, after hundreds of millions, maybe billions, of ad impressions later, we learned we needed to be more efficient in our process. We really didn’t have a ton of visibility into the full inventory picture and it was difficult to forecast potential availability.</p>

<p>PRX’s Ad-Ops team did some serious spreadsheet magic to help manage the inventory. But a very large volume of inventory caused managing the sheets a challenge to manage. Quickly, the spreadsheet became so complex that it hit the limit of cells available in Google Sheets - something I wasn’t aware was realistically possible.</p>

<p>We were not certain if this was something to celebrate or if it was a cry for help. Certainly, the spreadsheet skills of our scrappy Ad-Ops team is undeniable and worthy of celebration - as they have worked tirelessly to successfully serve millions of ads in our podcasts in a month.</p>

<p>But there had to be a better way, a more efficient way that doesn’t rely on Google Sheets to track our ad inventory.</p>

<p>Consider forecasting. This well built spreadsheet was unable to keep up with changes and segments that would allow us to forecast future downloads without huge confidence buffers.</p>

<p>In other words, we have been leaving money on the table - money that the bulk of, goes back into the hands of our independent producers to create fine podcasts.</p>

<p>At PRX, we embrace the principles of design thinking and user centric design in building out our tech products. One of the central tenets of design thinking is fully understanding the needs of a single user and designing a product that fits their needs. In our case our user is the PRX Ad-Ops team.</p>

<p>If we correctly assume that the needs of the PRX Ad-Ops team are the same needs of other Ad-Ops teams in podcasting, then we have a product that would be helpful to independent podcasters across the industry.</p>

<p>So we, the PRX tech team, after hearing the cries of our Ad-Ops team started to work hand in hand with our Ad-Ops teams to consider how we could simplify the process of ad inventory management by solving for two goals, as outlined above:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Developing a better forecast of podcast performance</li>
  <li>Retiring the Google Spreadsheet</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="forecasting">Forecasting</h2>

<p>To more accurately forecast, we started by adding a Production calendar feature into our Dovetail Publish CMS and encouraging producers to add drafts of when they know future episodes will drop - even if its only a date in the future.</p>

<picture><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/dovetail/1-production-calendar-200-96d7022f9.webp 200w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/1-production-calendar-400-96d7022f9.webp 400w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/1-production-calendar-800-96d7022f9.webp 800w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/1-production-calendar-1196-96d7022f9.webp 1196w" type="image/webp" /><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/dovetail/1-production-calendar-200-b46d94dce.png 200w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/1-production-calendar-400-b46d94dce.png 400w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/1-production-calendar-800-b46d94dce.png 800w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/1-production-calendar-1196-b46d94dce.png 1196w" type="image/png" /><img src="/assets/generated/img/dovetail/1-production-calendar-800-b46d94dce.png" alt="screenshot of the production calendar in Dovetail" width="1196" height="665" /></picture>

<p>In addition, we also have a lot of IAB compliant data on how well our podcasts have performed historically. This data is made available in our Dovetail Metrics platform.</p>

<p><strong><em>Related: <a href="https://medium.com/prxofficial/five-features-of-prx-metrics-we-want-to-you-to-know-about-f3aceb15b47b">Here are five features in Metrics we want you to know about</a></em></strong></p>

<p>Knowing when episodes will drop and how they’ve performed historically allows us to predict how well we think a podcast is going to perform with some reliability using the statistical programming language R.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of one of the R generated forecasts:</p>

<picture><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/dovetail/2-forecast-200-65105894b.webp 200w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/2-forecast-400-65105894b.webp 400w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/2-forecast-800-65105894b.webp 800w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/2-forecast-1200-65105894b.webp 1200w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/2-forecast-1365-65105894b.webp 1365w" type="image/webp" /><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/dovetail/2-forecast-200-b1bcbf0b6.png 200w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/2-forecast-400-b1bcbf0b6.png 400w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/2-forecast-800-b1bcbf0b6.png 800w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/2-forecast-1200-b1bcbf0b6.png 1200w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/2-forecast-1365-b1bcbf0b6.png 1365w" type="image/png" /><img src="/assets/generated/img/dovetail/2-forecast-800-b1bcbf0b6.png" alt="screenshot of a forecast in Dovetail" width="1365" height="655" /></picture>

<p>There are variables to accuracy, like how new a show is, or how often a show publishes - for example we’ve found that podcasts that drop daily are much easier to predict. This will give our Ad-Ops team more confidence on how aggressively a show can be sold.</p>

<p>Our forecasts are also flexible enough to handle some more advanced targeting based on IAB 2.0 compliant and privacy focused segmented audience data, like location.</p>

<p><em>NOTE: As of May 1, 2023, PRX is now IAB certified.</em></p>

<h2 id="inventory-order-input">Inventory Order Input</h2>

<p>Early in the process of building out inventory management capabilities we identified benchmarks for shows by the complexity of their advertising needs. We knew we couldn’t retire the aforementioned Inventory spreadsheets until we moved all of our podcasts over to the new system, helping us to identify the features we absolutely needed to have vs those we didn’t right away.</p>

<p>The first thing we identified is that we needed to ensure that our Ad-Ops team had a simple and easy to use application in which they can quickly add new IOs and segment them as they need.</p>

<picture><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/dovetail/3-flight-form-200-088c01dcb.webp 200w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/3-flight-form-400-088c01dcb.webp 400w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/3-flight-form-800-088c01dcb.webp 800w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/3-flight-form-1200-088c01dcb.webp 1200w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/3-flight-form-1600-088c01dcb.webp 1600w" type="image/webp" /><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/dovetail/3-flight-form-200-4a1d5ef54.png 200w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/3-flight-form-400-4a1d5ef54.png 400w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/3-flight-form-800-4a1d5ef54.png 800w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/3-flight-form-1200-4a1d5ef54.png 1200w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/3-flight-form-1600-4a1d5ef54.png 1600w" type="image/png" /><img src="/assets/generated/img/dovetail/3-flight-form-800-4a1d5ef54.png" alt="screenshot of campaign and flight entry in Dovetail" width="1674" height="810" /></picture>

<p>What we think is the best feature of the campaign insertion form is the near real time forecasts available as you target ad zones within the podcast.</p>

<p>We also created a dashboard that allows campaign managers to quickly view and filter campaigns and flights to more easily manage and track the orders that have already been added.</p>

<h2 id="availability-at-a-glance">Availability at a Glance</h2>

<p>PRX has a strong partnership with Market Enginuity for our podcast ad sales. One critical element of replacing the inventory spreadsheets was to create a simple view for Account Executives to quickly look up availability.</p>

<p>Therefore, we’ve built a dashboard that does just that. Look up availability:</p>

<picture><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/dovetail/4-avails-search-200-a36665b18.webp 200w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/4-avails-search-400-a36665b18.webp 400w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/4-avails-search-800-a36665b18.webp 800w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/4-avails-search-1200-a36665b18.webp 1200w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/4-avails-search-1600-a36665b18.webp 1600w" type="image/webp" /><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/dovetail/4-avails-search-200-7fdc6376a.png 200w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/4-avails-search-400-7fdc6376a.png 400w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/4-avails-search-800-7fdc6376a.png 800w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/4-avails-search-1200-7fdc6376a.png 1200w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/4-avails-search-1600-7fdc6376a.png 1600w" type="image/png" /><img src="/assets/generated/img/dovetail/4-avails-search-800-7fdc6376a.png" alt="screenshot of availability search in Dovetail" width="1669" height="768" /></picture>

<h2 id="our-commitment-to-listener-privacy">Our Commitment to Listener Privacy</h2>

<p>PRX is strongly committed to listener privacy. We are IAB 2.0 compliant, we only store a quartile of an IP address and we don’t track what you listen to – only that someone downloaded a podcast.</p>

<p>PRX believes that the future of digital ads is in contextual advertising; where advertisers buy ads against content, not listeners. This will help keep more money in the pockets of our producers - allowing them to create more engaging content that you want to listen to.</p>

<p>Within Dovetail, we are continuing to improve our platform to increase content tagging capabilities and discoverability.</p>

<picture><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/dovetail/6-category-blocks-200-e0f90e613.webp 200w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/6-category-blocks-400-e0f90e613.webp 400w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/6-category-blocks-800-e0f90e613.webp 800w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/6-category-blocks-1200-e0f90e613.webp 1200w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/6-category-blocks-1600-e0f90e613.webp 1600w" type="image/webp" /><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/dovetail/6-category-blocks-200-96898a1f4.png 200w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/6-category-blocks-400-96898a1f4.png 400w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/6-category-blocks-800-96898a1f4.png 800w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/6-category-blocks-1200-96898a1f4.png 1200w, /assets/generated/img/dovetail/6-category-blocks-1600-96898a1f4.png 1600w" type="image/png" /><img src="/assets/generated/img/dovetail/6-category-blocks-800-96898a1f4.png" alt="screenshot of Brand Safety category selection in Dovetail" width="1671" height="749" /></picture>

<h2 id="privacy-forward-programmatic-advertising">Privacy-forward Programmatic Advertising</h2>

<p>While we believe in the future of contextual advertising, there are use cases in which it makes sense to carefully use programmatic advertising exchanges to help our producers. For example, we have a large show with a large international audience, and programmatic is a way to help fill availability inventory.</p>

<p>We also have a lot of small shows or new shows that may be considered too small to sell ads into directly. In this case, programmatic ads can really help a show get off the ground floor.</p>

<p>VAST tags are becoming a standard in podcasting to request programmatic ads. We’ve worked with AdsWhizz to create a way to use VAST, while protecting listener privacy. This may mean that we won’t have access to all of the exchanges that exist, or have the ability to target listeners in all the ways possible, and that is fine by us. We want to vet and understand the sources for the ads our listeners receive.</p>

<p>Fortunately, our partners at Market Enginuity have created a privacy forward programmatic ad exchange that we can pull ads from to help producers.</p>

<p>PRX’s <a href="https://www.prx.org/services/publishing-platform">publishing platform</a> is at the heart of our mission to serve audio creators. It allows producers to easily add new content and distribute it across an ever increasing list of listening apps and technologies (like smart speakers.)</p>

<p>In the past year, we’ve been working hard to further deliver on this mission by adding new features to Metrics, our in-house data platform that allows producers to see the impact of and audience for their stories. It shows all the unique downloads for podcast audio, from every platform and player, so that producers can realize their vision, take measurable risks, and make more meaningful media.</p>

<p>The tech team is proud of our recent work because of the value Metrics brings to producers. Here’s what Sandi Barr, PRX Senior Software Engineer and Metrics Champion™ says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <em>It’s so important for podcasters to have access to and be able to make the most out of their data. The podcasts we carry on PRX are owned and managed by the users — independent producers, media companies, and public radio stations. We’re so proud that we can offer them a platform along with our guidance and leadership in the industry to help them better understand and make use of their data to grow their reach.</em>

<h2 id="how-metrics-works">How Metrics Works:</h2>

<p>The glue of the PRX publishing platform is <a rel="noopener" href="/prxofficial/on-dovetail-618153c4d67e">Dovetail</a>, an application that seamlessly inserts sponsorship messaging with podcast episodes uploaded into our content management system, Publish. Also inserted into each episode by Dovetail is a pixel tracker that counts when an episode is streamed or downloaded.</p>

<p>Dovetail then provides the data in its API to Metrics, which displays it in a frontend built using Angular.</p>

<p>Note: PRX strongly believes in user privacy.<strong> </strong>All the pixel tracker collects are a count of the download, a timestamp, the user-agent reported from the app itself, and a portion of the IP address to report location.<strong> None of this can directly tie back to a single listener, meaning the listener is fully anonymous to our publishing platform.</strong> <strong>All we know is that somebody listened, not who.</strong> Furthermore, we do not collect any information on what other podcasts people may be listening to. What they listen to is their business, not ours.</p>

<p>I’d like to highlight 5 features of Metrics that empower creators.</p>

<h2 id="1-near-real-time-data-updates-and-flexible-time-selection">1) Near real time data updates and flexible time selection</h2>

<picture><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/metrics-body-1-200-19febdfa2.webp 200w, /assets/generated/img/metrics-body-1-400-19febdfa2.webp 400w, /assets/generated/img/metrics-body-1-720-19febdfa2.webp 720w" type="image/webp" /><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/metrics-body-1-200-8a4ea7ec2.png 200w, /assets/generated/img/metrics-body-1-400-8a4ea7ec2.png 400w, /assets/generated/img/metrics-body-1-720-8a4ea7ec2.png 720w" type="image/png" /><img src="/assets/generated/img/metrics-body-1-720-8a4ea7ec2.png" alt="screenshot of PRX Metrics date selection" width="720" height="374" /></picture>

<p>Our producers can begin to track episode performance as soon as they publish an episode. Metrics has the latest data within minutes of a new listen being recorded by Dovetail, allowing producers to receive live updates of traffic on an episode.</p>

<p>Users can measure episode performance in custom time ranges based on the unique cadence of each show (daily, weekly, seasonality).</p>

<h2 id="2-drop-day-charts">2) Drop day charts</h2>

<picture><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/metrics-body-2-200-78c55a2c2.webp 200w, /assets/generated/img/metrics-body-2-400-78c55a2c2.webp 400w, /assets/generated/img/metrics-body-2-720-78c55a2c2.webp 720w" type="image/webp" /><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/metrics-body-2-200-6f536a087.png 200w, /assets/generated/img/metrics-body-2-400-6f536a087.png 400w, /assets/generated/img/metrics-body-2-720-6f536a087.png 720w" type="image/png" /><img src="/assets/generated/img/metrics-body-2-720-6f536a087.png" alt="screenshot of PRX Metrics drop day charts" width="720" height="247" /></picture>

<p>Leveraging real time data, we built a Drop Day chart to help creators see for themselves how episodes compared to one another in the hours and days following an episode drop. This allows producers to better understand the timing of releasing podcast episodes.</p>

<p>For example, if a producer of a weekly podcast releases a podcast a few hours later than normal (or even a day later,) they can directly see the impact that the publishing delay may have on traffic, positive or negative.</p>

<h2 id="3-easily-switch-between-your-shows">3) Easily switch between your shows</h2>

<p>Many of the creators that use our publishing platform produce multiple podcasts, so we’ve provided easy ways to navigate between them.</p>

<h2 id="4-aggregated-show-downloads-you-can-see-a-single-episode-or-compare-releases">4) Aggregated show downloads. You can see a single episode, or compare releases.</h2>

<picture><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/metrics-body-4-200-56b09cb18.webp 200w, /assets/generated/img/metrics-body-4-400-56b09cb18.webp 400w, /assets/generated/img/metrics-body-4-720-56b09cb18.webp 720w" type="image/webp" /><source sizes="(max-width: 480px) calc(100vw - 16px), (max-width: 768) 80vw, 1200px" srcset="/assets/generated/img/metrics-body-4-200-c1eb8ea6a.png 200w, /assets/generated/img/metrics-body-4-400-c1eb8ea6a.png 400w, /assets/generated/img/metrics-body-4-720-c1eb8ea6a.png 720w" type="image/png" /><img src="/assets/generated/img/metrics-body-4-720-c1eb8ea6a.png" alt="screenshot of PRX Metrics episode list" width="720" height="339" /></picture>

<p>To this point, we’ve focused a lot on tracking individual episodes, but creators can also check data across a series of episode releases and export it to CSV or Google Sheets. Data is also rolled up to easily see how your selected range compares to the all-time stats for a show.</p>

<h2 id="5-information-about-where-listeners-are-located-and-the-apps-they-use-to-hear-your-show">5) Information about where listeners are located, and the apps they use to hear your show</h2>

<p>Previously, I mentioned how Dovetail’s pixel tracker collects some non-personally identifiable data. We report this to producers using Metrics through maps, charts and tables. Producers can look up listenership by country or metro area (DSM), as well as by device and the podcast app used — assuming the podcast app provides a user-agent we can use to track. This gives producers useful information to make marketing decisions regarding ad spend and promotion opportunities.</p>

<hr />

<p>To conclude, many folks played a part in the development of Metrics, but I’d like to single out three for a shout out: the aforementioned Sandi Barr, Technical Lead Ryan Cavis, and Director of Design Chris Kalafarski. 🌮 Tacos all around.</p>]]></content><author><name>Brandon Hundt</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[PRX’s Metrics platform empowers audio producers with download and audience data]]></summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://dovetail.prx.org/assets/img/metrics-post-1.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://dovetail.prx.org/assets/img/metrics-post-1.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
