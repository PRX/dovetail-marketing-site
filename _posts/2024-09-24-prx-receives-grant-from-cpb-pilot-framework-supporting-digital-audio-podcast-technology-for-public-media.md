*Boston, MA September 24, 2025* –– Public media organization and distributor [PRX](https://prx.org) today announced it has been awarded a [$ insert amount] grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) to pilot a framework of fortifying digital audio technology for the public media system. 

As podcast and on-demand audio consumption accelerates among listening audiences, PRX will expand the use of its [Dovetail](/) publishing platform for the PRX Digital Audio Pilot for Public Media, creating a path to fortify and broaden the digital audio infrastructure of public media with technology that is also built, owned, and operated by public media.

PRX invites 30 public media stations nationwide to participate. Stations participating in the PRX Digital Audio Pilot for Public Media and implementing the Dovetail digital audio publishing platform will together take steps to further unify in a public media system strengthened into the future. 

[Quote from Kerri/PRX -for example ‘Public media needs its own shared platforms and services to ensure universal and equitable access, efficient operation, innovation, and collaboration. PRX Dovetail is the infrastructure that can connect these dots.’]

[Dovetail from PRX](/stations) enables public media stations to expand service to their communities with on-demand audio and to bolster their organizations. The platform provides: 
* Capability to deliver content to current and new audiences across station-owned platforms plus all major on-demand podcast listening platforms
* Tools for understanding and growing audience through capabilities such as real-time audience data and metrics
* Tools for rapidly identifying and forecasting underwriting, sponsorship, and monetization opportunities 
* Inventory management for ads, custom messages or alerts, digital fundraising drives, and promotions 
* A values-aligned, privacy-first suite of applications 
* Integration with existing technology infrastructure 

Stations of all sizes interested in participating in the PRX Digital Audio Pilot for Public Media may contact PRX at [insert web page]. 

Dovetail from PRX is used and trusted by PBS as well as GBH, KERA, WUNC, WAMU, WWNO, and more, including Pulitzer Prize and Peabody Award-winning producers with podcasts and digital audio heard by millions.
