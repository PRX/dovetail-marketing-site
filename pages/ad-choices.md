      <h4>Publishers can target ads by geolocation.</h4>
      Dovetail uses <a href="https://www.maxmind.com/en/opt-out" target="_blank">MaxMind</a> to geolocate an IP to a postal code or larger geographic region, but it never identifies a street address. <a href="https://www.maxmind.com/en/opt-out" target="_blank">You can learn more, limit, and opt out of MaxMind geolocation.</a>

      <h4>Publishers can use targeted programmatic advertising.</h4>
      Dovetail can be used by publishers to integrate with 3rd party programmatic advertising. For some jurisdictions, publishers can choose to send IP addresses in programmatic requests, where they could be used for targeting, such as cross-context behavioral or interest based ads. <a href="/opt-out" target="_blank">You can choose to opt-out of Dovetail sending your IP address in programmatic ad requests.</a>
