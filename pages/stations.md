    <p class="lead">We’re ecstatic to share that we’ve increased our ability to offer PRX’s podcast publishing platform, Dovetail, to your public radio organization.</p>
    <p>If you already publish podcasts or if you are exploring podcasting, we hope you will consider Dovetail for your podcast distribution needs.</p>
    <p>PRX’s platform is built on the trusted values of public media. It is vital to preserve, protect, and expand our ecosystem.</p>
    <p>While there are a slew of options today, the majority are spun out of a for-profit model. For this reason, PRX offers a major differentiator.</p>

    <h2 class="display-6">Dovetail Pricing for Stations</h2>
    <p class="lead">Pricing scales with your needs and we are committed to more affordable feeds than distribution platforms from for-profit organizations.</p>
    <p>Regarding costs, the use of Dovetail for public radio stations will entail its own fee for the station, separate from membership and content purchases.</p>
    <p>We are mindful that organizations of different sizes have different needs and capabilities. There are also several options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Full service––in-depth assistance and onboarding with PRX, added partnership with the public media sponsorship firm Market Enginuity (revenue share is a factor), and the PRX team is available to help traffic ads.</li>
      <li>Self-service—producers sell and run their own ads while enjoying the full benefits of Dovetail. To mark the difference between self and full service: full service is more hands-on in onboarding and in ongoing service.</li>
      <li>Self-service is lower cost for the producer.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Fees for Dovetail will be lower than those run by for-profit organizations and platforms.</p>
    <p>We welcome conversation to discuss your needs and to determine the best route regarding pricing.</p>
