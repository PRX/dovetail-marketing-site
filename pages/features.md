    <p>Dovetail's dynamic ad insertion capabilities allow you to optimize monetization. Best-in-class ad insertion technology seamlessly stitches sponsorship messages into produced audio, at any break in your show, with specific targeting (for example, by geo-location).</p>
    <p>The platform also allows flexibility for different business models. For example, you can monetize across a whole catalog, or just on a single episode. The platform also allows for both host-read ads or pre-produced ads.</p>
    <p>Dovetail supports all types of advertising campaigns, from house ads to sponsorship. And, the platform provides you with comprehensive reporting and analysis, as well as inventory forecasting.</p>
    <p>Dovetail features ensure that no money is left on the table. For example, producers can easily monetize their full back catalogs.</p>
