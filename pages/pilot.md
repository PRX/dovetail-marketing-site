    <p>With support from CPB, we’re strengthening public media’s infrastructure for on-demand audio and podcasting. This will be achieved by expanding access to PRX’s Dovetail publishing platform to more stations in this pilot program.</p> 
    <p>Dovetail from PRX is already used and trusted by PBS as well as GBH, KERA, WUNC, WAMU, WWNO, and more, including Pulitzer Prize and Peabody Award-winning producers with podcasts and digital audio heard by millions.</p>
    <p>The platform provides:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The ability to deliver content to current and new audiences across station-owned platforms plus all major on-demand podcast listening platforms</li>
      <li>Tools for understanding and growing audience through real-time audience data and metrics</li>
      <li>Tools for rapidly identifying and forecasting underwriting, sponsorship, and monetization opportunities</li>
      <li>Inventory management for ads, custom messages or alerts, digital fundraising drives, and promotions</li> 
      <li>A values-aligned, privacy-first suite of applications</li>
      <li>Integration with any existing technology infrastructure</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Stations of all sizes are eligible and space in the pilot is limited. CPB’s support means there would be no cost to your station for implementing Dovetail during this pilot period.</p> 
    <p>The 30 stations who are chosen to participate will implement the Dovetail digital audio publishing platform within their current system.</p>
    <p><strong>Public media stations nationwide are <a href="https://forms.gle/wuMFAa6tNCjayEfSA">invited to apply</a> to participate.</strong></p> 
    <p>Upcoming webinars will also help explain more. Dates and times will be announced soon.</p>
